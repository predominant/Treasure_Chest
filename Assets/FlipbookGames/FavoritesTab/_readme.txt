1. Introduction

Favorites Tab[s] is an Editor extension Unity that helps users access their most often used assets and scene objects, such as prefabs, behavior scripts, scenes, asset folders, or perhaps scene objects they are currently working on. Special care has been taken to extremely simplify adding new favorite items and removing them! These functions are always easily accessible as toggle buttons shown on Hierarchy and Project view items, even when no Favorites tab is visible. Favorite items are displayed with a star icon to help users spot them more easily. Recently an option to change the colors of stars has been added (through a context menu on the star icons).


2. Motivation

As the project grows with new assets and number of scene objects increases on a daily basis finding assets and scene objects becomes more and more difficult. As a result the development becomes slower and slower as the project advances into later stages. The Favorites Tab[s] was created in order to improve the common workflow inside Unity Editor and keep the pace of the development process fast regardless of project's and scene's size or their current stage.


3. How to use the Favorites Tab[s]

No special training is needed to start using the Favorites Tab[s]. It was designed to be used simply and easily since the beginning. Common knowledge of using the Unity Editor should be sufficient to work with the Favorites Tab[s] since its UI, functionality, and its overall look and feel follow the standard user interface elements of the Editor. The Favorites Tab[s] works and looks very similar to the standard Hierarchy and Project views, which not only helps to blend and fit nicely within Editor's environment, but it also minimizes the time spent to start using the Favorites Tab[s] efficiently.

Just in case, here's a short description of the Favorites Tab[s]' UI:

- To open a new Favorites tab choose Window->Favorites from the main menu, or View->Add Tab from the Favorites tab's toolbar. You can also use the Ctrl+T (Cmd+T) shortcut while a Favorites tab is focused.
- To add a new item click the hollow star icon displayed next to items in the Hierarchy and Project views. The icon turns into a yellow star and remains there to indicate that the item is in your list of favorites.
- To remove items from the favorites list click the yellow star icon displayed next to them in the Hierarchy and Project views, or use item's context menu inside the Favorites tab.
- To change the star colors of favorite items right-click the star icon and select the color from the context menu.
- Select items in the Favorites tabs same as you would do that in the Hierarchy and Project views, using keyboard or mouse. Multiple selections are also supported.
- Drag items from the Favorites tabs and drop them on other Editor views to perform various actions, same as you would do that from Hierarchy and Project view.
- Double-click scene object items to frame them in the Scene view, same as you would do that in the Hierarchy view.
- Double-click asset items to open them, same as you would do that in the Project view. 
- Search for items by name inside a Favorites tab, same as you would do that in the Hierarchy and Project views. Use the Ctrl+F (Cmd-F) shortcut to focus the search box and Esc to move the focus back on the list, or simply simply use the mouse for these actions.
- Activate or deactivate filtering by type from the search field's drop-down menu.
- Sort items in the Favorites Tab by name or type using the drop-down menu of the View toolbar button. Also check the About box from there ;)
- Enjoy this improved workflow and don't forget to share your feedback ;)

Useful tip: To clear your list of favorites simply select all items inside a Favorites tab with Ctrl+A (Cmd-A) then right-click and select 'Remove from Favorites' in the context menu.
